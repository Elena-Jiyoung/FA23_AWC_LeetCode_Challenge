# Welcome 👋🏻

Starting this semester, to boost our coding skills and get prepared for technical interviews, AWC is holding a LeetCode Challenge! This will go on until the end of the semester, and the winner will be selected by the number of submissions.

## How to join the challenge

### Method 1 - Using Github

  1. DM Kenzy on Discord your GitHub email.
  2. Once Kenzy adds you to the repo, simply **fork** the repository(this one!).
  3. Make the folder with your name and PSU email ID (like 'Jane Doe (abc1234)'). This new folder will be your workspace throughout the semester.
  4. Work on the problem 👩‍💻 -- Problem will be posted on the Discord channel, #leetcodes.
  5. Push your work into your **forked repo**.
  6. Make a pull request.
  7. Done!

> ⛔️ **An important note** -- don't modify the content of other people's folders! Kenzy will be going to review your submission, though it's better if we make as little merge conflict as possible for everyone's sake. 
> If you need any help on Git setup, always DM Kenzy on Discord!

### Method 2 - Submit to Kenzy via DM

  1. Work on the problem.
  2. Submit your solution to Kenzy through Discord DM.
  3. Done!

It's up to you which method you use to submit your work, I encourage you to use Git as we are going to use Git for the rest of our lives 🤓 

## Is there a reward?

**YES!** At the end of the semester, the winner will receive a **$25 Gift Card** of their choice & **BONUS POINT** on their GHC application. On top of everything, you will feel more comfortable with technical interviews, which is the ultimate goal we want to achieve!!!

## Rules

  1. **No cheating, please, PLEASE!** -- Remember, this is a learning experience for you 🫵. If you cheat, *you will learn **nothing** from this challenge.*
  2. When you are submitting your solution, provide a **brief explanation** of why you came up with this solution. If you are using Git to submit answers, you can provide us with markdown documentation(.md file) or use comments in your file. Explanation doesn't have to be long! As long as it's legit, even a sentence is fine!
  3. If you looked up the outside reference to get help note that too.
  4. The submission of the week will close on Sunday at 11:59 PM

> Any questions regarding the challenge, DM Kenzy!
